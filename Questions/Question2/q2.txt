Question 2.a: The "git status" command is not mandatory but it's good practice.
We want to use the command to view the status of our repository and the items within it.
This allows us to avoid forgetting to add folders and files to be tracked and helps identify issues.

Question 2.b: By executing the node command in the default terminal we enter the Node REPL
or the node terminal where we can execute JavaScript commands but not Bash or powershell commands such as "ls," "git status," and "pwd."

Inside the Node REPL the ".help" command pulls up a list of helpful commands -- including the ".exit" command which exits the Node REPL.
